# ReconX-Go  
Modular Reconnaissance Framework  
Author: **Ahmed Ibrahim**

ReconX-Go is a lightweight, extensible reconnaissance framework designed with a clean architecture and modular workflow.  
The project provides a structured environment for building recon utilities, report generators, parsers, and CLI tools in Go.

This project does not include scanning or offensive capabilities by default.  
Instead, it provides a stable foundation for building your own modules in a clean and organized manner.
